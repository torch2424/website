# Limitations

Compiling untyped JavaScript to WebAssembly doesn't make sense because it would ultimately result in shipping another (slower) JavaScript runtime that runs within a JavaScript runtime.

Instead, AssemblyScript focuses on where WebAssembly excels and does not support falling back to super dynamic features of JavaScript that cannot be efficiently compiled ahead of time:

Mandatory types
---------------

* No `any` or `undefined`.
* No union types.
* Nullable types must be reference types, annotated as `ClassType | null`.

Limited type inference
----------------------

* If there is no initializer expression, the type must be annotated.
* If there is an initializer expression:

  * If the initializer is an integer literal, `i32` is assumed when it fits into 32-bits, otherwise `i64` is assumed.
  * If the initializer is a float literal, `f64` is assumed.
  * Otherwise the initializer is evaluated to obtain its type.

Other
-----

* Optional function parameters require an initializer
* `const` globals and locals require a compile-time constant initializer and otherwise fall back to a mutable variable.
* In JavaScript, static fields on classes are always evaluated when defined, whereas in AssemblyScript, built-in tree shaking lazily compiles static fields when referenced.
* When calling an exported variable-length arguments WebAssembly function from JS, e.g.

  ```ts
  export function add(a: i32 = 1, b: i32 = 2): i32 {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

  the actual number of parameters of the call must be specified explicitly because there is no equivalent to `arguments.length` on the WebAssembly side. Example:

  ```js
  exports._setargc(0);
  exports.sum(); // 3

  exports._setargc(1);
  exports.sum(2); // 4

  exports._setargc(2);
  exports.sum(2, 3); // 5
  ```
