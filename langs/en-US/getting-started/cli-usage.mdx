Using the compiler
------------------

Similar to TypeScript's `tsc` compiling to JavaScript, AssemblyScript's `asc` compiles to WebAssembly:

```
Syntax:   asc [entryFile ...] [options]

Examples: asc hello.ts
          asc hello.ts -b hello.wasm -t hello.wat
          asc hello1.ts hello2.ts -b -O > hello.wasm

Options:
 --version, -v          Prints just the compiler's version and exits.
 --help, -h             Prints this message and exits.
 --optimize, -O         Optimizes the module. Also accepts the optimize level:

                         -O     Uses defaults. Equivalent to -O2s
                         -O0    Equivalent to --optimizeLevel 0
                         -O1    Equivalent to --optimizeLevel 1
                         -O2    Equivalent to --optimizeLevel 2
                         -O3    Equivalent to --optimizeLevel 3
                         -Oz    Equivalent to -O but with --shrinkLevel 2
                         -O3s   Equivalent to -O3 with --shrinkLevel 1 etc.

 --optimizeLevel        How much to focus on optimizing code. [0-3]
 --shrinkLevel          How much to focus on shrinking code size. [0-2, s=1, z=2]
 --validate, -c         Validates the module using Binaryen. Exits if invalid.
 --baseDir              Specifies the base directory of input and output files.
 --outFile, -o          Specifies the output file. File extension indicates format.
 --binaryFile, -b       Specifies the binary output file (.wasm).
 --textFile, -t         Specifies the text output file (.wat).
 --asmjsFile, -a        Specifies the asm.js output file (.js).
 --idlFile, -i          Specifies the WebIDL output file (.webidl).
 --tsdFile, -d          Specifies the TypeScript definition output file (.d.ts).
 --sourceMap            Enables source map generation. Optionally takes the URL
                        used to reference the source map from the binary file.
 --noTreeShaking        Disables compiler-level tree-shaking, compiling everything.
 --noDebug              Disables maintaining of debug information in binaries.
 --noAssert             Replaces assertions with just their value without trapping.
 --noEmit               Performs compilation as usual but does not emit code.
 --noMemory             Does not set up a memory. Useful for low-level WebAssembly.
 --importMemory         Imports the memory instance provided by the embedder.
 --memoryBase           Sets the start offset of compiler-generated static memory.
 --importTable          Imports the function table instance provided by the embedder.
 --noLib                Does not include the shipped standard library.
 --lib                  Adds one or multiple paths to custom library components and
                        uses exports of all top-level files at this path as globals.
 --use, -u              Aliases a global object under another name, e.g., to switch
                        the default 'Math' implementation used: --use Math=JSMath
 --trapMode             Sets the trap mode to use.

                         allow  Allow trapping operations. This is the default.
                         clamp  Replace trapping operations with clamping semantics.
                         js     Replace trapping operations with JS semantics.

 --runPasses            Specifies additional Binaryen passes to run after other
                        optimizations, if any. See: Binaryen/src/passes/pass.cpp
 --feature              Enables additional (experimental) WebAssembly features.

                         sign-extension  Enables sign-extension operations
                         mutable-global  Enables mutable global imports and exports

 --transform           Specifies the path to a custom transform to 'require'.

 --measure              Prints measuring information on I/O and compile times.
```

Scaffolding with asinit
-----------------------

Once AssemblyScript [has been installed](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript#installation), it provides a handly little tool to scaffold a new project:

```
Syntax: asinit [project directory]

Sets up a new AssemblyScript project or updates an existing one.

For example, to create a new project in the current directory:

  asinit .
```

Example output:

```
This command will make sure that the following files exist in the project
directory '/home/user/mymodule':

  ./assembly
  Directory holding the AssemblyScript sources being compiled to WebAssembly.

  ./assembly/tsconfig.json
  TypeScript configuration inheriting recommended AssemblyScript settings.

  ./assembly/index.ts
  Exemplary entry file being compiled to WebAssembly to get you started.

  ./build
  Build artifact directory where compiled WebAssembly files are stored.

  ./build/.gitignore
  Git configuration that excludes compiled binaries from source control.

  ./index.js
  Main file loading the WebAssembly module and exporting its exports.

  ./package.json
  Package info containing the necessary commands to compile to WebAssembly.

The command will try to update existing files to match the correct settings
for this instance of the compiler in '/home/user/mymodule/node_modules/assemblyscript'.

Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]

- Making sure that the project directory exists...
  Exists: /home/user/mymodule

- Making sure that the 'assembly' directory exists...
  Created: /home/user/mymodule/assembly

- Making sure that 'assembly/tsconfig.json' is set up...
  Created: /home/user/mymodule/assembly/tsconfig.json

- Making sure that 'assembly/index.ts' exists...
  Created: /home/user/mymodule/assembly/index.ts

- Making sure that the 'build' directory exists...
  Created: /home/user/mymodule/build

- Making sure that 'build/.gitignore' is set up...
  Created: /home/user/mymodule/build/.gitignore

- Making sure that 'package.json' contains the build commands...
  Created: /home/user/mymodule/package.json

- Making sure that 'index.js' exists...
  Created: /home/user/mymodule/index.js

Done!

To edit the entry file, open 'assembly/index.ts' in your editor of choice.
Create as many additional files as necessary and use them as imports.

To build the entry file to WebAssembly when you are ready, run:

  npm run asbuild

Running the command above creates the following binaries incl. their respective
text format representations and source maps:

  ./build/untouched.wasm
  ./build/untouched.wasm.map
  ./build/untouched.wat

  ^ The untouched WebAssembly module as generated by the compiler.
    This one matches your sources exactly, without any optimizations.

  ./build/optimized.wasm
  ./build/optimized.wasm.map
  ./build/optimized.wat

  ^ The optimized WebAssembly module using default optimization settings (-O2s).
    You can change the optimization settings in 'package.json'.

Have a nice day!
